# NodeMongoDBTodoApi
Rest Api using Node, Express and MongoDB

More details:
REST APIs for Todo Application  (Node.JS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Mocha Testing, Heroku and mLab)
* Created REST APIs for CRUD operations for Users and their Private Todos using async â€“ await for asynchronous functions.
* User authentication done using JWTs, Auth Tokens, Hashing and Private routes managed using Express Auth middleware.
* Tested REST API endpoints using Mocha, SuperTest and Expect assertions.
* Used MongoDB Database and Mongoose ODM and managed configuration using Postman and Robo Mongo.
* Deployed app and MongoDB database on Heroku using mLab MongoDB.


Correct Steps to access API:
* All the routes for the API are handled in server/server.js and authentication middleware is present in server/middleware. The mongoose models is defined in server/models.
* Currently, there is no front end web interface to access the API so ways to access it is through code or an Application like Postman. Postman is the best option.
* User authentication is implemented using JWTs, Auth Tokens and Hashing so the routes will not be accessible without a token.
